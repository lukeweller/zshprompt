# Add personal ~/bin to path
PATH=$PATH:~/bin

# CUSTOM ALIASES
# --------------

# Default ls to color
alias ls="ls --color=auto"

# Add macOS-style open
alias open="xdg-open"

# Adds keyword for easier screenshots
alias snip="gnome-screenshot -a"

# Alters behavior of 'which' in order to enable commands in bg-vault-client while using zsh
alias which="command which"

# TL;DR from Jacob Thomas:
#  * which in zsh is a builtin instead of a command
#  * bg-vault-client uses which as a command
#  * adding [alias which="command which"] to your ~/.zshrc forces
#	 zsh to use the command which instead of the builtin, which
#	 forces bg-vault-client work as expected
